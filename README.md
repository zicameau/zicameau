### Adventure and Coding

Hello! My name is Trevor and welcome to my Github profile readme. I am a nearly graduated undergraduate student coming out of San Jose State University with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering. I spend most of my time here working on personal projects or contributing to school projects currently.

Languages I Excel At:
Python 3,
Swift,
C++,
HTML,
CSS,

Languages I am Mediocre At:
Java,
Javascript,

Most of my time at University has been spent learning about verification and validation. In other words, ensuring that we are building the product right and ensuring that we are building the right product respectively. These two terms can encompass nearly all of my education as all other subjects branch from these two terms.

My hobbies include hiking, cooking Indian curry, video games and socializing. Check out my last trip I went on in the photo!
